        <h3>who.</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Rishabh Jois. I am a passionate and motivated software developer currently employed at <i>Epic Systems</i>, based out of Madison, WI.
            At Epic, I conduct full stack development on self-directed projects to introduce novel, integrative workflows. Under previous employers, I have presented 
            intuitive, data-driven dashboards to business executives and coached college students through rigorous chemistry labs.

        <h3>how and why.</h3>
        <p>
            My love for coding began in Bangalore, India, where I used play with Terrapin Logo and Scratch in my elementary school's computer lab. That love persisted 
            with me throughout middle and high school until I ultimately pursued a degree in Chemical Engineering. All it took was one intro computer science course 
            to make me revert my decision and switch my career track to software development.
        </p>
        <p>
            What pulled me back to software is that there is so much freedom and versatility that comes with it. There are limitless opportunities to make innovative 
            ideas a reality, which anybody with a computer, motivation, and some spare change could take advantage of. I want to innovate - change peoples' lives - so 
            that we as a society can operate on a more equal, happier playing field.
        </p>

        <h3>what.</h3>
        <p>
            Outside of software development, I enjoy playing basketball, doing puzzles, and writing stories. I am also picking up an essential life skill - cooking! I 
            like staying up to date with all the latest technology and sports news. I also like to travel and I most recently visited Japan in Spring 2024. Feel free to 
            reach out if you ever want to chat!

    <!--<p>I will be pursuing my Masters in Computer Science online starting next Spring. I am excited to learn more about Deep Learning for Healthcare, Cloud Computing Applications, Data Mining, etc. and work on improving my skillset.</p>-->
